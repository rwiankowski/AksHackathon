# Azure Hackathon for AKS

## Why

Parts Unlimited just signed the contract and became your new customer. They want you to host their MRP system for them on Azure and explicitly requested that you use Azure Kubernetes Service to run the application.

## How

It's now your job to create a design which will allow you to host the application in a Mission Critical way. That means that you have to maximize reliability, resiliency and security. You will take operational responsibility to deliver the 100% promise. Make your choices based on that.

## What

The components of the application along with the relevant documentation can be found here:

https://github.com/microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRPmicro

Use the application as a reference for a customer case. Consider focusing on one of the more aspects of the design:

- Compute and Availability
- Monitoring and Alerting
- Network, Load Balancing and Service Discovery
- Ci/CD and Deployments
- Security and RBAC

and describe it in detail. Be ready to present and discuss your choices.
